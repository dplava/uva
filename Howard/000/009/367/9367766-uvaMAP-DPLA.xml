   <dcterms:description>Birdwood Pavilion is used today for conferences and special events. The brick plantation house sits on land patented in 1739, and it was called Birdwood as early as 1810. The antebellum house, built between 1819 and 1830 for plantation owner William Garth, may have been constructed by men who worked on the University Rotunda and Lawn as well. A Colonial Revival wing was added in the early 20th century. The distinctive stand-alone brick water tower was added by owner Hollis Rinehart, an engineer, in 1909, to provide extra water by gravity flow to the house. The University acquired the house and its 550-acre property in 1974 from the estate of Cornelius W. Middleton. Debates ensued for years over Birdwoodâ€™s virtue as a site for a residential college. Once that plan was abandoned, the house was renovated in 1980 for use as a conference center. -- https://www.virginia.edu/webmap/popPages/9-birdwoodpav.html [work]</dcterms:description>
