   <dcterms:description>The Bulloch-Habersham House in Savannah inspired New York architect Henry Hornbostel’s design of Habersham Memorial Hall in Ansley Park. This Atlanta structure was completed in 1923. The Bulloch House in Savannah was demolished in 1916 and the site is currently a parking lot. -- http://historyatlanta.com/habersham-memorial-hall/ [work]</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>Habersham Memorial Hall, the chapter house for the Joseph Habersham Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, is a 20th-century building modeled after the circa 1819 Bulloch-Habersham House in Savannah, Georgia, designed by William Jay. The Hall is located near Piedmont Park in the neighborhood of Ansley Park. While the exterior of the Hall is a replica of the Savannah home, the interior was designed not for residential living, but for the purpose of meetings and entertainment. Hornbostel's design for Habersham Memorial Hall is a fine example of the Regency style of William Jay, adapted in form and use for the 20th century. It was designed in 1921 by New York architect Henry Hornbostel.... [work]</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>Built in 1921, this two-story, hipped roof, brick-stuccoed building has a semi-circular portico. The two-story hexastyle portico has stuccoed columns with composite order capitals and a semi-conical roof that appears to fit into a central gable in the hip roof. The capitals are detailed with spread eagles and acanthus leaves. The first floor doors open out onto a brick paved terrace, level with the portico but above ground level. The second-story window and door openings are protected by cast iron railings and detailed with the initials, "JHC," representing the Joseph Habersham Chapter. The interior features a central hall, off of which are identical rooms, and a smaller stair hall that leads to the kitchen and a stairway. On the front facade are French doors which open out onto the terrace. The ceiling has open beam work with a deep beaded cornice. A vast assembly room comprises most of the second floor. It is not open to the public. -- http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/atlanta/hab.htm [work]</dcterms:description>
