   <dcterms:description>"The Fordyce Bathhouse operated from 1915-1962, when it closed due to declining business. It remained vacant until reopening as the park visitor center in 1989." -- http://www.nps.gov/hosp/planyourvisit/fordyce.htm [work]</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>"...the most elaborate and was the most expensive of the bathhouses, the cost including fixtures and furniture being $212,749.55 US. It was closed on June 29, 1962, the first of the Row establishments to fall victim to the decline in popularity of therapeutic bathing. Fordyce Bathhouse has served as the park visitor center since 1989. The Fordyce bathhouse was built in 1914â€“15, designed by George Mann and Eugene John Stern of Little Rock, Arkansas. Its surpassing elegance was intentional, as Samuel Fordyce waited to observe the Maurice's construction to find out if he could build "a more attractive and convenient" facility." -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathhouse_Row [work]</dcterms:description>
