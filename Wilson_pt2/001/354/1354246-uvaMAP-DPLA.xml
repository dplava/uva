   <dcterms:description>The first house that Wright ever created was his own home in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park. Built in 1889, the young architect was only twenty-two years old when he designed his shingle style abode. Visitors are commonly taken aback by the appearance of the Frank Lloyd Wright Home, often expecting a house with a low profile, and long, horizontal lines, but it would be more than a decade before Wright would develop his first fully mature Prairie House. The most immediate, striking feature of the house, and a trait that would be seen in all of Wright’s work to come, is its strong sense of geometry. When looking at the house, one immediately notices the giant triangle, the gable. The eyes then begin to sense the texture of the shingled façade. The house is set far back on the lot, and the trees frame the house in a lovely, picturesque manner. The home foreshadows the direction Wright’s architectural evolution would take, following a period of experiment and transition, when the client’s wishes were nonnegotiable. -- http://www.thefranklloydwrighttour.com/flwhomestudio.htm [work]</dcterms:description>
