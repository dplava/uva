   <dcterms:description>Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site in southeastern Berks County, near Elverson, Pennsylvania, is an example of an American 19th century rural "iron plantation". The buildings include a blast furnace, the ironmaster's house and auxiliary structures including a blacksmith's shop, a company store and several worker's houses. The tenant houses were built by the furnace to house workers. Rent for the smaller houses was about $12 to $25 a year. At one time the furnace owned fourteen tenant houses, but not all of them were in the immediate vicinity of the furnace. Many of the Hopewell workers owned homes and farms nearby. Many of the tenants owned a milk cow, raised chickens, and grew vegetables in small gardens. The boarding house may date to 1807. The boarders were mainly single men who ate their meals at the moulder’s kitchen in the basement of the ironmaster’s mansion. -- http://www.nps.gov/hofu/forteachers/upload/sgtour.pdf [work]</dcterms:description>
