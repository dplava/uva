   <dcterms:description>The property dates as early as the 1150 and was associated with the Siward Family.The Oliphants obtained the barony of Kellie in 1361. Construction on the tower house probably began in the 15th century. A second tower was erected in the 16th century, possibly 1573. Remodeled in 1603-1606. The two towers (SE and NW) were linked by range, a new tower (SW) was added, the original two heightened.The estate was sold in 1617 to Thomas Erkskine, first Earl of Kellie. In 1661, the windows were enlarged and the house was remodelled internally. In 1724 and 1790 further alterations were made to the property. It was abandoned prior to 1878 when James Lorimer leased it. John Currie was commissioned to restore the property. Robert Lorimer also aided in the restoration and was responsible for the gardens.
