   <dcterms:description>The Hill of Tarvit has a long history with evidence for occupation since the Iron Age. A tower was erected in 1500 by the Inglis family, who then sold it in 1611 to Sir John Scott. It was remodeled by Sir John. It was remodelled again in 1696 by John Wemyss, who built a new house after abandoning the tower. Additions were added. In 1904 F.B. Sharp purchased the estate and Lorimer was commissioned to carry out the remodel. The ulititarian wings were retained by the central block was rebuilt. Lorimer was also responsible for the gardens. Scott Morton &amp; Company was responsible for the woodwork; Thomas Beattie and Samuel Wilson were responsible for the ceilings. (Wikipedia and The Buildings of Scotland).
