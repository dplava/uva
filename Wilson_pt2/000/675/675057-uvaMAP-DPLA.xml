   <dcterms:description>Central Synagogue, today one of the nation's leading Reform congregations, began as Congregation Ahawath Chesed, founded in 1846 by German-speaking Bohemian immigrants on Ludlow Street in the Lower East Side. By 1870, the membership of Ahawath Chesed had prospered and grown, and a decision was made to move farther uptown. Henry Fernbach, New York's first prominent Jewish architect, was commissioned to design the new synagogue, which was built in 1872 and seated more than 1,400 individuals. Fernbach created an elaborate and intricate interior with Moorish designs whose contours were stenciled onto the sanctuary walls and then hand painted. For the sanctuary floor, a space of nearly 4,000 square feet, Fernbach ordered more than 20,000 encaustic tiles from England and alternated that pattern with bands of brown quarry tile. The sanctuary was lit with gas-fired chandeliers that hung from arches beneath the galleries, as well as by 12 double-story stained-glass windows. The exterior, an interpretation of the Tabac-Schul (Dohány Street) Synagogue in Budapest, features decorative stone with three entrance portals and two side-aisle entrances, surmounted by a great rose window and twin 122-foot gilded-copper onion domes each topped with a five pointed star. The cost of the original project was $300,000. -- http://www.nycago.org/Organs/NYC/html/CentralSyng.html [work]</dcterms:description>
