   <dcterms:description>The U.S. Customhouse at Portland, Maine is a historic custom house located in Cumberland County, Maine. It was built to house offices of the United States Customs Service at Portland, Maine, a port of entry for the United States. Located near Portland's waterfront, the U.S. Custom House is a testament to the city's maritime history. It was built to accommodate the city's growing customs business, which, by 1866, was collecting $900,000 annually in customs duties - making Portland one of the most significant seaports in the country. The U.S. Custom House is a skillful blend of the Renaissance Revival and Second Empire styles, which were popular in the United States during the mid- to late 19th century. Its original design is largely intact. The three-story, free-standing, I-shaped structure is constructed of New Hampshire granite with a slate-shingled hipped roof. he U.S. Custom House has experienced only minor changes since it was constructed, and therefore exhibits a high degree of architectural integrity. The U.S. Custom House is the best remaining example of Mullett's work in the state of Maine and continues to serve its original function. [work]</dcterms:description>
