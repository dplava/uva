   <dcterms:description>General Sir William Pepperell (1696-1759), the hero of Louisburg, was the first American born baronet, and the richest man in what was then the Province of Maine. After his death, his widow, the former Mary Hirst, built a dower house a mile from the old mansion. This small, forthright mansion with its bold ionic pilasters on under a central pediment, is one of the loveliest houses in Maine. The bracketed doorway features two intertwined dolphins. On this basis, the house has often been attributed to Peter Harrison, the English architect of Kingâ€™s Chapel in Boston, and the Redwood Library in Newport, as have the Apthorp and Longfellow houses in Cambridge, which share similar compositions and details with the Pepperell House. Inside, the house features handsome simple rooms, beautiful cornices, deep windows with folding shutters and window seats. A staircase with twisted balusters, and simple paneled chimney breasts project into the rooms between windows to handsome effect. http://downeastdilettante.wordpress.com/2009/12/19/palladian-perfection-new-england-style-part-2-the-lady-pepperell-house-at-kittery-point-maine/ [work]</dcterms:description>
