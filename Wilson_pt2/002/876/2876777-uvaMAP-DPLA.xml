   <dcterms:description>The factory buildings, Administration Building, and Clock Tower were unusual in that the architectural design and treatment defied the common practice of having drab, uninteresting building for industrial use. The Pullman buildings were given an architectural identity and set in a park-like setting. In front of the Administration Building was the beautifully landscaped Lake Vista -- an artificial lake created to serve as a cooling reservoir for the Corliss Steam Engine. The factory buildings provided unusually good working conditions for employees. The factory buildings were well lighted and ventilated. The walls were painted in light colors to create a cheerful atmosphere. They were not to be compared to the sweatshops of the time. The cars were constructed in assembly line fashion, a remarkable method for the time. -- http://www.pullman-museum.org/theCompany/theFactory.html [work]</dcterms:description>
