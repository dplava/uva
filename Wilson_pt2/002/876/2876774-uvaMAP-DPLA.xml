   <dcterms:description>One of the original buildings in railroad industrialist George Pullman's workers' community in the historic Pullman District. Debuting in 1881, the four-story Queen Anne-style Hotel Florence housed visiting dignitaries and businessmen in Gilded Age style. It's currently being restored by the Pullman State Historic Site. Designed by Solon S. Beman. Location: 11111 S. Forrestville Ave. -- http://www.frontdoor.com/photos/open-house-chicago-pullman-hotel-florence-pullman [work]</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>The Hotel Florence opened on November 1, 1881 as the hospitality showcase for visitors to George Pullman's "perfect town" of Pullman. The hotel was named for George's favorite daughter, Florence. The hotel building cost $100,000 to build and interior fixtures and furnishings totaled over $30,000. The original main building contains over 23,000 square feet, with the later "Annex" addition, built in the 1910's. The building was originally lighted with gas lights and heated with steam radiators, the steam generated by the Corliss Engine located across the street in the factory buildings. The Historic Pullman Foundation bought the Hotel Florence in 1975 to save the aging building from demolition and to renovate it. In 1991, it was sold to the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency as an integral part of the Pullman State Historic Site. Today, the Hotel is undergoing a major capital improvement program by the state to restore the Hotel for future use with the State Historic Site. -- http://www.pullmanil.org/hotelflorence.htm [work]</dcterms:description>
