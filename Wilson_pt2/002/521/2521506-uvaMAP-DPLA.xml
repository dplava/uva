   <dcterms:description>Designed in 1869 by William LeBaron Jenney, the young military engineer Olmsted had met at the siege of Vicksburg during the Civil War. The Riverside Water Tower was a technological marvel of steam driven pumps providing a safe, reliable water supply to village residents. The water tower served as a beautifully designed advertising piece, calling attention to the passengers on the trains stopping at the station, that something special and different was growing here along the Des Plaines River. The tower also provided an observation platform from which lots could be sold by taking prospective purchasers up and showing them how their new house could be situated in relation to the City of Chicago visible to the east. The water tower was designed ... in a Swiss Gothic style, a style shared in part by the Riverside Hotel (built in 1871) and by many of the original 1870s homes. Tragically, in the early hours of New Years Day, 1913, a fire destroyed the wooden tank, the pump house, and much of the upper stories of the tower. By the fall of 1913, architect William Mann had submitted a plan for a rebuilt tower that added twenty feet to the structure and replaced the wooden tank with an iron one. -- http://www.riversidemuseum.net/water-tower.html [work]</dcterms:description>
