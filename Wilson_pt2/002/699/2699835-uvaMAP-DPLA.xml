   <dcterms:description>Sagamore was reputably William West Durant's favorite home, he lived here until financial circumstances forced him to sell to Alfred G. Vanderbilt in 1901. The Vanderbilt family owned Sagamore until 1954. Following the plan of Durant's previous camps, the 1,524 acre estate was built on a peninsula jutting out into the lake, Shedd Lake, which was renamed Sagamore. In 1913 the Vanderbilts decided to make Sagamore their main vacation home and began a two-year program of expansion and improvement. Telephone service was installed in 1914 as well as a water and sewage system as advanced as any city in the country. In 1915 electricity replaced the gas lights. After Vanderbilt's death in 1915, his widow kept the Sagamore property until 1954 when it was deeded to Syracuse University. It is now run by the Sagamore Institute, a non-profit organization. Professor Howard Kirschenbaum and his wife Barbara Glaser, created the National Humanistic Education Center in 1970 and were instrumental in saving Sagamore from being torn down and the land returned to the state. In 1976 Sagamore was listed on the National Register of Historic Places with additional buildings added in 1986. In 2000 Sagamore was named by the National Park Service as a National Landmark. -- http://www.sthubertsisle.com/page169.html [work]</dcterms:description>
