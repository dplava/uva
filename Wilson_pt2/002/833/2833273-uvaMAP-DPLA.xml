   <dcterms:description>Top of building</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>Originally designed by Edward W. Saunders to have thirteen floors but only three were completed as the Great Depression began. In 1930, Saunders described it as having several types of architecture faintly suggested in the building and its decoration. "But, as a whole, the type is distinctly Modern." Today its style is now recognized as the early phase of Art Deco. The building is sometimes better known as The Pythian Building. [work]</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>The original, decorated lobby remains today. It contains colorful tile wainscoting, ornate plaster coffered ceilings, mosaic tile floors, detailed cast iron railings, and etched glass windows and light fixtures The ornate exterior terracotta work is in good condition and is virtually unaltered, although the South canopy was demolished in 2000.
