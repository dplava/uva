   <dcterms:description>Set includes telescope lens, obturator, cord and electrodes, extra lamps, and additional items. Instruments contained within a wooden case with "Brown-Buerger Cystoscope" label affixed to the inside. Brown-Buerger instruments were first produced in 1917 and were highly versatile, able to be used as a cystoscope or urethroscope. They were created by Leo Beurger, based on a design by Tilden Brown. "1972" and "Vest" are written on the outside of the wooden case. Samuel A. Vest was the Director of the UVA Department of Urology from 1941-1958. This set was used by an unknown UVA urologist at a clinic in Norton, VA, during the 1960s and 1970s. [original]</dcterms:description>
