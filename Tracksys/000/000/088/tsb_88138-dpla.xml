   <dcterms:description>One of 200 examples printed, but only one of 7 known in this format. -- Schwartz.</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>SPECIAL COLLECTIONS: Copy 1: On 2 sheets, as printed. Sheet one contains 3 separate strips of the map, two containing a portion of the linear title. The cartouche is printed at the end of the third strip. The second sheet contains the North/South portion of the line, with the extension to the East. Has watermark of J. Whatman and royal seal GR.</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>SPECIAL COLLECTIONS: Copy 2: Presumably issued as above. The three strips have been cut apart, reassembled in the proper linear manner, connected to the 2nd sheet, and matted to form one map, 65 x 185 cm. In order to make the proper connection with the second sheet, the cartouche was removed from its original position and placed on the left side of the mat below the actual map. The whole is matted and framed. Seymour I. Schwartz Bequest, 2020. Schwartz number 201.</dcterms:description>
