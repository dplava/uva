   <dcterms:description>From excerpt: Roughly equal numbers of anti-abortion and abortion rights supporters squared off on opposite corners of Lee Street on August 2, 1990 to express themselves on the Medial Center's April 1 decision to stop performing elective abortions of fetuses matured beyond 14 weeks. According to a hospital statement, the Medical Policy committee made the change based on "health hazards involved in second trimester abortions and on the concerns of health care professionals here who perform abortions." The policy is not affecting the number of abortions performed at the hospital because of an effort to speed up scheduling of abortions for women whose pregnancies are approaching the deadline, said hospital spokesman Tom Doran. According to the policy, in unusual circumstances such as rape or incest, elective abortions will be performed up to 20 weeks gestation. In cases where the life of the mother is threatened or severe abnormalities are present in the fetus, abortions will be performed at any gestational age. University doctors performed 225 elective abortions last year.</dcterms:description>
