   <dcterms:description>William Banks Sr., hired [William] Pauly, the first landscape architect licensed in Georgia and designer of downtown Atlanta’s Hurt Park, to create a plan for the grounds. Typical of grand estates, Pauly’s design placed formal gardens close to the house, leaving outlying areas largely untouched and creating natural vistas. [work]</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>[William] Banks first fell in love with the house when he visited it in 1958. It was then located in the Georgia hamlet of Haddock, about an hour east of Atlanta. Abandoned for years, the house, built in 1828, was designed by New England architect and builder Daniel Pratt. Years later, after purchasing a home in Temple, New Hampshire, Banks began to research the town’s history. Imagine his surprise when he discovered that Pratt, who eventually moved to the South, was one of Temple’s native sons. When the Georgia house became available in the late 1960s, Banks had to have it. In 1968, following the death of his father, he had the house moved to Coweta County, where, with his mother’s blessing, he razed the old house and replaced it with the Federal one. The gardens went untouched. -- http://www.hortmag.com/gardens-and-gardeners/garden-visits/baks-garden#sthash.VvSru4Od.dpuf [work]</dcterms:description>
