   <dcterms:description>Anderson House, Rackham Court, Howard House, Sylvester House, Buck House, Brooks House, and the Chapel at Principia College were all designed and built by Bernard Ralph Maybeck between 1931-1935. In an effort to ensure success with his designs and materials, he experimented with them through the creation of a small building known affectionately by Principians as the "Mistake House." [Originally called Sample House] Maybeck personally supervised the construction of this cottage-like structure erected as a point of reference for methods and materials in the new college construction. It was his intention to use the Sample House as a basis for written instructions coming from his San Francisco office to the architects and construction supervisors in his Elsah office. The little building illustrates all kinds of construction techniques, including half timbering mixed with brick, concrete, and stone. http://www.principia.edu/users/els/orgs/maybeck/build/mistake.htm From the beginning of the planning of Principia, the student body had requested that the Chapel be the first building constructed, and they asked that it be American Colonial in style. After studying meeting houses and churches in Massachusetts and the exposed site high on a bluff overlooking the river, Maybeck developed a design that involved the use of steel, concrete, and Bedford Indiana limestone. In order to avoid the "institutional effect," Maybeck placed the windows with uneven spacing. http://www.principia.edu/users/els/orgs/maybeck/build/chapel.htm [work]</dcterms:description>
