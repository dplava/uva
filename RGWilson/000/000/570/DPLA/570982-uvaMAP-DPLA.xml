   <dcterms:description>The Eliestoun Estate represents the work of both a noted architect and a landscape architect and is a good illustration of the typical setting and buildings of a country estate of a wealthy 19th century family. In 1883, Henry S. Turner, Jr. married Ada Ames. In 1888, Turner purchased the Starr farm adjoining the Ames estate in order to build his own country estate. With his status and wealth Turner sought out an Eastern architect, Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow, nephew of the famous American poet. To Principia College, Eliestoun was an important part of the College's early days. When The Principia purchased the Ames and Turner Estates in late 1930, Eliestoun's main house was one of the buildings suitable for immediate occupancy. It was used during the building program (1931-1935) for guests to the building site, such as Bernard R. Maybeck and his wife Annie, as well as for Principia administrators, such as Mary Kimball Morgan, the founder of the school, director Frederic Morgan, and other staff. After the College occupied the campus, Eliestoun's main house was the official residence of the president of The Principia. This continued until 1959 when Hutchinson House was remodeled and used as the official residence. -- http://hcap.artstor.org/cgi-bin/library?a=d&amp;d=p1328 [work]</dcterms:description>
