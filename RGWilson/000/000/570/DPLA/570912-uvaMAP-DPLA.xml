   <dcterms:description>Anderson House, Rackham Court, Howard House, Sylvester House, Buck House, Brooks House, and the Chapel at Principia College were all designed and built by Bernard Ralph Maybeck between 1931-1935. Maybeck designed Anderson Hall with two projecting wings flanking a smaller central section, and he gave each section a steep hipped roof punctured by dormers. The terra-cotta roof tiles were carefully selecte by Maybeck in reddish hues around the ridge and greenish hues along the eaves, to create the impression of water having washed down from the ridge over many years and leaving moss growing on the eaves. On the west wing Maybeck placed a distinctive curved staircase made of fitted stone, which spirals up from the ground level to the main Gothic-arched entrance on the second story. Brick was the primary material on the exterior of Anderson Hall, but Maybeck didn’t like the look of clean brick surfaces. So he used a type of brick whose surface would flake off more quickly than regular brick, giving it an aged look soon after it was set. He also had every third course of brick pulled out a quarter inch or so from the rest of the wall, creating a pleasing shadow line that gave visual richness to the façade. http://books.google.com/books?id=yBgKkgOCaZEC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;lpg=PA194&amp;dq=anderson+hall+principia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=A4IkyaJKXV&amp;sig=c29mR16JfC3-BsqXp2MfmAKr4vM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZvTYT5vxE6e36QGWie2HAw&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=anderson%20hall%20principia&amp;f=false [work]</dcterms:description>
