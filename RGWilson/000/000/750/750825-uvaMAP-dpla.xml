   <dcterms:description>The Canterbury Shakers built their first school in 1823. The original School House was a one-room, one-story building not unlike schools built elsewhere in New Hampshire at the time. n 1862, the School House was moved less than two hundred yards south of its original location, which was just north of the arboretum. The new site was much closer to the hub of daily community activity, but separated from farm animals and agricultural pursuits. Shortly thereafter, the Shakers decided to expand. Not wanting to waste the school's new roof, they jacked the building up and built a first floor addition underneath. The entrance and stair tower were built on the east side, joining the school house to a small woodshed and privy. -- http://www.shakers.org/dwelling-house.html [work]</dcterms:description>
