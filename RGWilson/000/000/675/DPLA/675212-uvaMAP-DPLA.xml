   <dcterms:description>The Gothic Revival church building was constructed in 1844-1845 according to a design by Richard Upjohn, and was consecrated in 1846. In 1853 Upjohn completed the Parish House and Rectory on West 20th Street, and in 1854 he built the Sister's House. The design of the church, which features brownstone blocks chosen for placement at random, made the church "one of the most influential buildings of the 19th century". It was: "[the] first asymmetrical Gothic Revival church edifice in the United States ... Upjohn designed the building to resemble a small medieval English parish church .... In the 1970s the building was sold and had several uses over the next 40 years, including drug rehabilitation programs, night clubs, and fitness centers. Currently (2022) the home of Limelight Fitness. -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Holy_Communion_and_Buildings [work]</dcterms:description>
