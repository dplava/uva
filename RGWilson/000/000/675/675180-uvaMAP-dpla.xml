   <dcterms:description>The Gothic Revival church building was constructed in 1844-1845 according to a design by Richard Upjohn, and was consecrated in 1846. In 1853 Upjohn completed the Parish House and Rectory on West 20th Street, and in 1854 he built the Sister's House. The design of the church, which features brownstone blocks chosen for placement at random, made the church "one of the most influential buildings of the 19th century". It was: "[the] first asymmetrical Gothic Revival church edifice in the United States ... Upjohn designed the building to resemble a small medieval English parish church ... The church's founder, the Reverend William Muhlenberg, a leader of the evangelical Catholic within the Episcopal Church, was closely involved with the design ... Muhlenberg believed that the Gothic style was "the true architectural expression of Christianity." By the 1970s, with the city at the depth of its financial problems, the neighborhood was virtually abandoned, being neither residential nor retail, excepting some car dealerships. In 1975 the declining parish...sold the Church of the Holy Communion to Odyssey House, a drug rehabilitation program, in order to meet its fiscal obligations. From 1983 until 2007, the church was utilized as a nightclub, The Limelight. After frequent problems with the police and charges of rampant drug abuse in the club, it was closed, but reopened in 2003 under the name "Avalon". It closed permanently in 2007. On May 7, 2010, the building was reopened as a retail mall called the Limelight Marketplace. -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Holy_Communion_and_Buildings [work]</dcterms:description>
