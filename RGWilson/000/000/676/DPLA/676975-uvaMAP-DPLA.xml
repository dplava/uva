   <dcterms:description>Portal statuary, designed by sculptor Simon Verity and carved by Jean Claude Marchionni</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>After an open competition, a design by the New York firm of George Lewis Heins and C. Grant LaFarge in a Byzantine-Romanesque style was accepted 1892. Increasing friction after the premature death of Heins in 1907 ultimately led the Trustees to dismiss the surviving architect, Christopher Grant LaFarge, and hire the noted Gothic Revival architect Ralph Adams Cram to design the nave and "Gothicize" what LaFarge had already built. Construction began 1892; in 1911, the choir and the crossing were opened. The first stone of the nave was laid and the west front was undertaken in 1925. Construction on the towers continued in fits and starts until the early 1990s, when a lack of funds forced its abandonment. Under master stone carvers Simon Verity and Jean Claude Marchionni, work on the statuary of the central portal of the Cathedral's western fa√ßade was completed in 1997. -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_of_Saint_John_the_Divine The Cathedral is almost exactly two football fields in length (601 feet or 186 meters) and the nave ceiling reaches 124 feet (37.7 meters) high. It is the longest Gothic nave in the world, at 230 feet. Seven chapels radiating from the ambulatory behind the choir are each in a distinctive nationalistic style, some of them borrowing from outside the gothic vocabulary. Known as the "Chapels of the Tongues" (Ansgar, Boniface, Columba, Savior, Martin, Ambrose and James), their designs are meant to represent each of the seven most prominent ethnic groups to first immigrate to New York City upon the opening of Ellis Island in 1892 (the same year the Cathedral began construction). -- http://www.nyc-architecture.com/HAR/HAR002.htm [work]</dcterms:description>
