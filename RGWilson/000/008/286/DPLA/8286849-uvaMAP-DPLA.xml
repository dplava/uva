   <dcterms:description>"The architect credited with this family chapel is Joseph Lyman Silsbee, who was a friend and architect for Jenkin Lloyd Jones, Wright's uncle and a prominent Unitarian minister for the south side of Chicago. This was the first time that wright worked under an architect, and it is not exactly certain what his duties were. He did, however, get a taste for the process. The chapel is set in the family cemetery, concealed within a group of trees, where Wright, Mamah Borthwick, and many of Wright's relatives are buried, along with many important associates from his apprentice program and architectural practice." -- Heinz, Frank Lloyd Wright field guide, 1996 [work]</dcterms:description>
