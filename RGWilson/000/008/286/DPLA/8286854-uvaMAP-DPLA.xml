   <dcterms:description>"This was the second building that Wright designed for his mother's sisters Jane and Nell; the first, Hillside School I, was built in 1887. This earlier school was to east of the present building, in what is now a parking lot... The second building's south facade was very similar to the Dana House, Spring Field, Illinois, which was to be Wright's next project... The stone walls lean slightly inwards at the top, making the school seem taller than it is. The school was altered after a second-floor fire which was apparently the result of leaf burning... Remodeled by Taliesin Preservation Committee in 1933, the gymnasium became the theater, and the chemistry rooms are now an exhibition space." -- Heinz, Frank Lloyd Wright field guide, 1996 [work]</dcterms:description>
