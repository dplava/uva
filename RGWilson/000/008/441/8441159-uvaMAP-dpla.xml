   <dcterms:description>General view</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>In 1949, Sternberg embarked on another challenging commission. Denver was growing, little new housing had been built during the war years, and affordable housing available to modestly paid University of Denver faculty members was virtually non-existent. [...] Sternberg was appointed as architect for the project. Sternberg and Johnson themselves were members of the [Mile High Housing] Association, which was largely composed of faculty members. In consultation with the membership, Sternberg developed a plan for the 11-acre alfalfa field bought by the Association. It was an opportunity to use much of his British planning background. -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Sternberg [work]</dcterms:description>
