   <dcterms:description>"...a home in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illinois, United States designed by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright in 1895. It was constructed in 1898 and occupied by a Marshall Field and Company salesman. The design elements were employed a decade later when Wright designed the Unity Temple in Oak Park. The house is listed as a contributing property to the Ridgeland-Oak Park Historic District which joined the National Register of Historic Places in December 1983. The George W. Smith House was designed in 1895 by architect Frank Lloyd Wright as one of a series of low-cost homes for engineer and inventor Charles E. Roberts. However, like several others for Roberts, the Smith house was not built at the time of its design. The home's eventual owner and namesake, George W. Smith, was a salesman for the Chicago firm Marshall Field &amp; Company." -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Smith_House_%28Oak_Park,_Illinois%29 [work]</dcterms:description>
