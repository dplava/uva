   <dcterms:description>"From 1908 to 1931, Cass Gilbert was the consulting architect to Oberlin College in Ohio. As consulting architect, Gilbert undertook the design of several campus buildings. His first building on campus was Finney Chapel (1906-1908), while the last was the Graduate School of Theology, a quadrangle complex, which was completed in 1931... The Theology Building (Bosworth Hall) has a commanding presence on Tappan Square. Its central feature is a Romanesque-inspired bell tower crowned by a hipped roof of Oberlin's signature red clay tile. The arched entrance below the tower leads to the austere Fairchild Chapel. Colonnades both enclose the courtyard and connect Bosworth Hall to the rest of the former theology “campus,” now known as Asia House." -- http://www.cassgilbertsociety.org/works/oberlin-theology/ [work]</dcterms:description>
