   <dcterms:description>When it first opened its doors to the public in 1894, the Leland Stanford Jr. Museum was unique among American museums, having been privately founded by a family with a general collection of world art on a par with the great public museums being built at the time. By the turn of the century, the Stanford museum was the largest privately-owned museum building in the world. Its archeological and ethnological holdings were a rarity on the Pacific Coast, and by 1905 its collection of Asian materials was unsurpassed in the western United States. The catastrophic San Francisco earthquake of 1906 devastated the building. It leveled two wings, brought down the Egyptian, Roman, and Asian galleries, and shattered more than a thousand Cypriot pots. Three-quarters of the huge structure, much of which has been standing empty awaiting future acquisitions, was irreparably damaged.http://museum.stanford.edu/explore/timeline2.html [work]</dcterms:description>
