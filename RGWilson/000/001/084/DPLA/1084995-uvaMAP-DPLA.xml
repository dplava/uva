   <dcterms:description>St Mary's was built by a Duke and has suitably noble proportions. It was designed and constructed between 1865 and 1868 for William, 8th Duke of Bedford, by the architect Henry Clutton. Clutton had just finished another church for his patron at Tavistock, on the Russell estate there. It was an equally grand conception in the Romanesque style. Clutton was a student of French medieval architecture. He won a competition to design a Cathedral at Lille but it was not constructed. Woburn was his compensation, a model of a French Gothic cathedral. St Mary's was originally built with a tall spire, which must have been a notable Bedfordshire landmark, and a crypt for the interment of members of the ducal family. The Russells have continued to rest at their family vault at Chenies in Buckinghamshire, however, and the spire had to be dismantled for safety reasons in 1890. This accounts for the rather squat and ungainly external appearance of St Mary's today: a somewhat gaunt building relieved only by the carved grotesques and gargoyles on the tower roof and waterspouts. -- http://www.woburnparishchurch.org.uk/history.html [work]</dcterms:description>
