   <dcterms:description>Danforth Memorial Library, also known as the Paterson Free Public Library, is located in Paterson, New Jersey. The library was built in 1905 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 1, 1984. -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danforth_Memorial_Library After the Great Fire of 1902 completely destroyed the original Danforth Memorial Library building, Charles Danforth's daughter, Mary E. Ryle, contributed $100,000.00 to rebuild a new library in her father's name. The Paterson Free Public Library was removed form the downtown business district to 250 Broadway. The architectural competition was won by Henry Bacon, designer of the Jersey City Library and the Lincoln Memorial. The cornerstone was laid by Mrs. Ryle in 1903. The building was opened to the public in May 1905. Mrs. Ryle did not live to see the opening, but prior to her death, she donated another $100,000.00 for its completion. -- http://mss3.libraries.rutgers.edu/dlr/showfed.php?pid=rutgers-lib:18702 [work]</dcterms:description>
