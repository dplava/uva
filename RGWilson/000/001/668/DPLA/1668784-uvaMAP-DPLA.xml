   <dcterms:description>The Keystone Building is the largest private office building designed by George Grant Elmslie. It also may be the largest office building designed in the Prairie Style. It was planned as the Joseph George &amp; Newhall Building in 1922. The Aurora Silverplate Company had previously occupied the building, but moved out onto another lot. Their old building was partially demolished and Elmslie was tasked with incorporating part of it into a new building. It was Elmslie's first commission since he split from his business partner William G. Purcell. L. A. Fournier, who had worked with Purcell &amp; Elmslie, was listed as an associate architect. The building was recognized by the National Park Service on its National Register of Historic Places on March 18, 1980. Furthermore, it is a contributing property to the Stolp Island Historic District, listed on September 10, 1986. -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_Building_%28Aurora,_Illinois%29 [work]</dcterms:description>
