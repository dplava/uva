   <dcterms:description>St. Giles' Church is a Roman Catholic church in the town of Cheadle, Staffordshire, England. The Grade I listed church was designed by Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin. Pugin was commissioned by John Talbot, the 16th Earl of Shrewsbury to create a church that "would have no rival" and so gave him unlimited resources with which to build it. It was opened and consecrated on 31 August 1846, and the next day the first Solemn Mass was celebrated inside. -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Giles%27_Catholic_Church,_Cheadle Serving the parish of Cheadle, Staffordshire, St Giles' is considered to be the finest of all the churches built by the celebrated nineteenth century architect and designer, A.W.N. Pugin. It was financed by John Talbot (1791-1852), sixteenth Earl of Shrewsbury. Begun in 1841 and completed in 1846, St Giles' is of unique importance in the history of the Gothic and Catholic Revival. -- http://www.stgilescatholicchurch.co.uk/ [work]</dcterms:description>
