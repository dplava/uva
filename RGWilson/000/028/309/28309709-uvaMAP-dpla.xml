   <dcterms:description>At the peak of its success in the 1840s, the Hancock community had more than 3,000 acres and 300 members. The community gradually declined, in part due to the urban migration that followed the Industrial Revolution. By the early 1900s, only 50 members remained, most of them children. Eventually, excess land was sold and many buildings were destroyed. Concerned citizens stepped in to preserve the Village in the 1960s. [work]</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>Today, the 750-acre Hancock Shaker Village operates as a living-history museum open to the public with 20 authentic Shaker buildings, collections of Shaker furniture and artifacts, activities and workshops, â€¦ and a working farm with extensive gardens and heritage-breed livestock. -- https://hancockshakervillage.org/home/history/ [work]</dcterms:description>
