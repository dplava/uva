   <dcterms:description>The House at the Minute was originally a late-Gothic house from the 15th century that was rebuilt in the high Renaissance style in 1564, and is famous for the numerous black and white sgraffitoes that were added to the facade in 1610. The house has served many purposes and has had varied names. At one time it was a pharmacy and called “The House at the White Lion” for the sculpture of the white lion at the corner. The house also once served as a tobacconist, and the current name, House at the Minute (House at the Diminutive), refers to the diminutive pieces of tobacco sold there. The sgraffitoes depict Habsburg rulers Philip II. of Spain, Rudolph II, Maxmilian II and some others. The writer Franz Kafka lived in the house with his family from 1889 to 1896. The house is now part of the complex of buildings incorporated into Old Town City Hall. -- https://www.flickr.com/photos/grufnik/4444625768; https://www.prague.eu/en/object/places/1736/the-house-at-the-minute [work]</dcterms:description>
