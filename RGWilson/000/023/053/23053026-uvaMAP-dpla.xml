   <dcterms:description>The greater part of the present church dates from rebuilding in the 13th century. At some time between 1480 and 1510, the top of the tower was rebuilt in Perpendicular style. Between 1700 and 1720, decorative features, including vases and a sundial, were added to the east face. ... In 1884–85 John Oldrid Scott carried out a major restoration. This included raising the level of the roof line, installing a new timber ceiling, adding a new west window in Decorated style, laying a new floor, and removing the box pews from the nave. In 1908, Lord George Curzon added a chapel to the north of the nave over a burial vault. This was a memorial to his wife, Mary, and was designed by G. F. Bodley. In 1910–12 the stained glass in the windows was replaced and additions were made to it. -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Saints_Church,_Kedleston [work]</dcterms:description>
