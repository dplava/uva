   <dcterms:description>William Thorsen was a lumber baron from Michigan who retired to California and purchased a lot in Berkeley. His wife, Caroline, was the sister of Nellie Canfield Blacker of the Robert R. Blacker House. Inspired by the Greene brothers' work and also the wife and daughter of lumbermen, she too wanted a wooden house like her sister's.The entry hall is paneled in teak while the living and dining rooms are paneled in Honduras Mahogany with ebony pegs covering the screws. The fireplace in the living room is surrounded with mauve Grueby tiles. The front door contains leaded art glass in the pattern of a gnarled grape vine, executed by Emil Lange. The Greenes were commissioned to make furniture originally only for the dining room, but they were later called back to make more pieces. -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorsen_House [work]</dcterms:description>
