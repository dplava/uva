   <dcterms:description>Maybeck purchased land in La Loma Park and subdivided it into irregularly shaped lots he sold to friends and family. In 1907, he built a sprawling family home at 2711 Buena Vista Way. After the house was destroyed in the 1923 Berkeley fire, they lived in several small structures built on the site. This one was called The Studio. Maybeck began this smaller house on the foundations of the old house and, with the desire to make it fireproof, experimented with Bubblestone, a waterproof, aerated cement invented by his friend John A. Rice. The material was cheap and easy to apply onto a wooden frame. A gelatinous mixture of glue, water, and formalin was whipped into a stiff foam, and the latter was mixed with Portland cement, sand, and water. Burlap sacks were then dipped into the frothy mixture and hung, shingle fashion, on slats nailed horizontally around the house. No skilled labor was required; edges were trimmed or hand-molded to fit around corners, doors and windows. The same material was applied on the roof. -- http://berkeleyheritage.com [work]</dcterms:description>
