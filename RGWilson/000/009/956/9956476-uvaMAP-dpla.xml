   <dcterms:description>On January 11, 1920, 57 people met to express their desire to become a Methodist congregation on the new Druid Hills campus of Emory University. The preacher that day was Bishop Warren A. Candler, brother of Asa G. Candler, the founder of the Coca-Cola Company. On February 15, 1920, the Emory University Methodist Church was formally organized. -- http://www.glennumc.org/our-history/ [work]</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>Emory University Methodist Church was founded in 1920 by members of the Emory community who were accustomed to Emory University requirement that students attend chapel every day and two times on Sunday. At its inception there were fifty seven members. The name was changed to Glenn Memorial in 1931 when the Glenn Memorial sanctuary-auditorium was built. -- http://album.atahistorycenter.com/store/Products/80082-glenn-memorial-methodist-church.aspx [work]</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>On February 15, 1920, the Emory University Methodist Church was formally organized. In 1930, a decision was made to build a beautiful new sanctuary on the campus. As plans unfolded, the members learned that the new building would be a memorial to the Rev. Wilbur Fisk Glenn, an Emory alumnus who for fifty years had been a Methodist minister and a leader of the church in the South. Wilbur Fisk Glenn, is the man for whom Glenn Memorial United Methodist Church is named. On October 4, 1931, the congregation held its first service in the new building, Glenn Memorial. A university publication reported, "At last the campus and the community have a real church edifice in which to worship, and for a few years, at least, Emory will have an auditorium large enough to accommodate its graduation exercises, musical concerts, and lectures." More than 80 years later, Glenn and Emory still share this space, which has been the basis of a strong and ever-growing relationship. -- http://www.glennumc.org/our-history/ [work]</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>The architecture of the building follows the Christopher Wren tradition that English colonists brought to America. The main body of the church is modeled after St. Michaels Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. The portico at the base of the 140 foot bell tower was derived from King’s Chapel in Boston, which is considered to be one of America’s finest examples of Georgian architecture. The tower itself, which is the most outstanding architectural feature of the church, is modeled after the bell tower of All Saints’, known as the “mother church” of the city of Bristol, England. -- http://www.albionscaccia.com/project.php?project=134 [work]</dcterms:description>
