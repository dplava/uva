   <dcterms:description>"In 1914, the county determined that the courthouse was too small for the city and they decided to build a new one. The old courthouse was sold and the new one, designed by the Minneapolis architect George Grant Elmslie in collaboration with the Sioux City architect William L. Steele and Elmslie's partner, William Gray Purcell, was constructed from July 10, 1916 to March 1, 1918 at a cost of $850,000. This building is the current courthouse. It is made of Roman brick and granite. It also has a 157-foot-tall tower on top of the building and features sculptural work by Alfonso Iannelli over its doors. In 1973, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1996." -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodbury_County_Courthouse [work]</dcterms:description>
