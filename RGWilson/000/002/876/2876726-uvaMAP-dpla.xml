   <dcterms:description>"The Green Stone Church" nickname comes from the hue of the Pennsylvania serpentine limestone of its facade. The town of Pullman, annexed to the city of Chicago in 1897, was developed in the early 1880's by the Pullman Palace Car Company, a manufacturer or railroad cars, for the benefit of company workers. The church of Romanesque design was built in 1882 to the plans of the town architect, Solon S. Beman, at a cost of $57,000. George Pullman, founder and president of the Pullman Company, was noted as saying the following about the church, "When the church was built, it was not intended so much for the moral and spiritual welfare of the people as it was for the completion of the artistic effect of the scene." For much of its first quarter-century, the building sat unused as no one congregation could pay the rent required of Pullman. In 1907, the church building was sold to the Methodist congregation for $15,000. The entire Pullman neighborhood gained National Historic Landmark status in 1971 and became an official Chicago Landmark in 1972. http://www.ohschicago.org/Organs/ChicagoPullman.html [work]</dcterms:description>
