   <dcterms:description>On February 21, 1919, the parish’s Annual Meeting approved the idea of building a new church. Bishop Thurston secularized the old building in November of 1921, and it was quickly disassembled. Ground was broken for the new church on the afternoon of December 11 and by the next day the congregation was worshipping in the Majestic Theater, where it would remain until the completion of the crypt of the new building. By June 4, 1922, the construction on the crypt of the new church was sufficiently advanced for the congregation to return home from the theater. The cornerstone for the new building was laid in 1925, with full Masonic ceremonies. The formal dedication of the building by the Rt. Rev. James Ridout Winchester, Bishop of Arkansas, was on May 9, 1926. -- http://www.trinitytulsa.org/#!trinitys-history/c12fg The church is a fine example of the English Gothic architectural style with its ecclesiastic stained glass windows and artistic wood carvings. The interior features beautiful colored floors, and these colors are matched in the ceiling. There are also stunning stained-glass windows, which depict the Apostles’ Creed. -- http://www.gpsmycity.com/tours/tour-of-tulsas-religious-buildings-5572.html [work]</dcterms:description>
