   <dcterms:description>General view</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>Christ Church is notable for its unique Georgian design. The church is the only colonial Virginia church that still has its original high-backed pews and one of two that has maintained its original three-tiered pulpit. The first church erected at the site was a wooden building, the construction of which was funded by powerful landowner John Carter in 1670. Carter died before the construction was completed, but was buried on the church grounds alongside four of his five wives. John Carterâ€™s son Robert, a wealthy vestryman and planter, decided that the parish deserved a more substantial place of worship and, in 1730, funded and supervised the construction of a brick building on the approximate foundations of the old wooden church. ... The three English table tombs of Robert Carter, Betty Carter, and Judith Carter stand just outside the east end. -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_Church_%28Lancaster_County,_Virginia%29; http://www.christchurch1735.org/architecture.html [work]</dcterms:description>
