   <dcterms:description>With a clear view of the renowned Old Faithful Geyser the Inn features a multi-story log and limb lobby with a massive (500-ton, 85-foot) stone fireplace and is flanked by long frame wings containing guest rooms. It is also constructed mostly from locally obtained materials including lodgepole pine and rhyolite stone. The inn is a prime example of the "Golden Age" of rustic resort architecture, a style which is also known as National Park Service Rustic. It is also unique in that it is one of the few log hotels still standing in the United States. It was the first of the great park lodges of the American west. When the Old Faithful Inn first opened in the spring of 1904, it boasted electric lights and steam heat. The structure is the largest log hotel in the world; possibly even the largest log building in the world. In 2007 the American Institute of Architects conducted a survey to determine the 150 favorite buildings in America; the Old Faithful Inn ranked 36. The Inn, which was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987, is itself part of the Old Faithful Historic District. Old Faithful Inn is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The Old Faithful Inn was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 23, 1973. It is the central element in the Old Faithful Historic District, which includes the Old Faithful Lodge on the other side of Old Faithful. -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Faithful_Inn [work]</dcterms:description>
