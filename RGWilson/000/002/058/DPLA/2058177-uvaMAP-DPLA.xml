   <dcterms:description>Building at south side of the cathedral, facade</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>Construction of the cathedral began in 1163 and was largely completed by 1260, though it was modified frequently in the centuries that followed. In the 1790s, during the French Revolution, Notre-Dame suffered extensive desecration; much of its religious imagery was damaged or destroyed. [work]</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>A major restoration project was undertaken between 1844 and 1864, by Jean-Baptiste Lassus and Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. Beginning in 1963, the cathedral's façade was cleaned of centuries of soot and grime. Another cleaning and restoration project was carried out between 1991 and 2000. [work]</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>On 15 April 2019, while Notre-Dame was undergoing renovation and restoration, its roof caught fire and burned for about 15 hours. The cathedral sustained serious damage as a result. The flèche (the timber spirelet over the crossing) was destroyed, as was most of the lead-covered wooden roof above the stone vaulted ceiling. The task of stabilizing the building against possible collapse was completed in November 2020, and reconstruction began in 2021. — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre-Dame_de_Paris [work]</dcterms:description>
