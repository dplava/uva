   <dcterms:description>The site is ancient; "hurst" is the Saxon term for an enclosed wood. A manor house with a three-armed moat was built here in the Middle Ages. … the house was given a new brick gatehouse in the 1530s by Sir John Baker … and greatly enlarged in the 1560s by his son Sir Richard Baker, when it became the centre of a 700-acre (2.8 km2) deer park. In August 1573 Queen Elizabeth I spent three nights at Sissinghurst. [work]</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>After the collapse of the Baker family in the late 17th century, the building had many uses: as a prisoner-of-war camp during the Seven Years' War; as the workhouse for the Cranbrook Union. ... [work]</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>By 1800, however, the house was neglected and decayed. At this time the building was partially demolished leaving substantial fragments for use as barns, stables and cottages for labourers. [work]</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>Sackville-West and Nicolson found Sissinghurst in 1930. … Although Sissinghurst was derelict, they purchased the ruins and the farm around it and began constructing the garden we know today. [work]</dcterms:description>
