   <dcterms:description>Forest Hills Gardens is a planned community located in Forest Hills, in the New York City borough of Queens. Its streets are privately owned but open to traffic. The area consists of a 142-acre (0.57 km2) development, fashioned after a traditional English village, that is one of America's oldest planned communities. It is modeled after the English planned garden suburb community Hampstead Garden Suburb, located near Golders Green, in London. The layout, with a central "square", and the similarity of many of the street names in both communities was clearly intentional. The community, founded in 1908, consists of about 800 homes, townhouses, and apartment buildings, mostly in Tudor, Brick Tudor or Georgian style, in a parklike setting designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. Designed with transportation access in mind, the community's central square is adjacent to the Forest Hills Long Island Rail Road station. -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Hills_Gardens,_Queens Grosvenor Atterbury renowned architect was given the commission to design the Forest Hills Gardens.
