   <dcterms:description>Grosvenor Atterbury renowned architect was given the commission to design the Forest Hills Gardens. The neighborhood was planned on the model of the garden communities of England. The Forest Hills Gardens were the first and are the oldest of the planned communities. Atterbury designed elegant, substantial Tudor and Colonial style homes. Frederick Law Olmstead, Jr. son of the landscape architect of New York Cityâ€™s Central Park was the landscape architect for the Forest Hills Gardens project. He planned curving streets lined with stately trees, closes, two small parks, Flag Pole Green, and Station Square. -- http://www.foresthillschamber.org/en/history//wiki/Forest_Hills_Gardens,_Queens Between 1909 and 1922, the Sage Foundation spent nearly a sixth of its capital to build Forest Hills Gardens, a model suburban community for working families designed by architect Frederick Law Olmstead. The aim was to demonstrate the economic and social viability of an intelligently planned suburban community. The first lots sold for $800, and a new suburb began thriving by 1917, but housing prices soon soared beyond the range of the families they were intended for. -- http://www.foresthillschamber.org/en/history/ [work]</dcterms:description>
