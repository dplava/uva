   <dcterms:description>General view</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>in the MéMé "everything communicates and opens, each element sees and can understand and meet the other. The floor slabs are open between one level and the next, the walls are cut out, the skylights are transparent everywhere, and the balconies are visible to one another. There are numerous entries, so people can come from anywhere, from the cellars to the attics and terrace staircases, from the walkways". This allows even what are often cumbersome restraints, such as fire escapes, to be dealt with in different ways. There is clearly a tribute here to the concept of community living and to a "transparent" society closely allied to the ideas of those years. --http://www.domusweb.it/en/architecture/2010/06/30/lucien-kroll-utopia-interrupted.html Students approached Kroll for an alternative to the monotonous design proposed by the university and conducted a successful campaign for its adoption. Developed in intense consultation with students and others who would use the building, an evolving physical model became a record of the design process. The resulting building has a fragmented look, as it was split into sections with each part handed over to a separate team of architects within the office. http://www.spatialagency.net/database/why/political/participation.1970s [work]</dcterms:description>
