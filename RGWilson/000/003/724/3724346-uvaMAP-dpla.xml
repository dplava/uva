   <dcterms:description>The Buck House is one of Schindler’s projects closely tied to the International Style. The architect demonstrated his use of geometry in order to communicate his theory of Space Architecture in this project. Unlike many of Schindler’s projects, the Buck House is situated on a flat site surrounded by other residences. The horizontal arrangement of the house is emphasized by its flat roofs of different heights that appear to float above the house due to a continuous strip of windows. The program of the Buck House includes three bedrooms and three garages located at street level, with a one-bedroom apartment that sits on top. Its layout is made up of two L-shapes that actually interlock three-dimensionally. The house is visually opened in the back, where the house embraces and acts as a frame around the patio. The overall structure is made up of wood frame with stucco. Clerestory windows were used to allow the penetration of light into all spaces. Interior partitions of translucent glazing break down the scale of the interiors and add visual interest and continuity to the house. However, these were probably created by J. J. Buck, who designed the interiors of clothing stores for women. Built-in cabinets run along an entire wall as a dining room installation. Some remodeling has occurred: a modern kitchen was installed, a bedroom has been opened up to its adjacent breakfast room, two columns have been added under the overhang of the main house, and a shading device was designed to shade the porch. Still, the space of the house has remained mostly unchanged and consistent with Schindler’s style of design. By controlling views with windows and visually extending the experience beyond enclosed space, the Buck house is an example of Schindler’s mastery of making space seem larger than it really is. -- http://www.countryclubprojects.com/exhibitions/the-buck-house/ [work]</dcterms:description>
