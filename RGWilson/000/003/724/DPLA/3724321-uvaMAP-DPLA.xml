   <dcterms:description>The historic Central Library Goodhue building was constructed in 1926 and is a Downtown Los Angeles landmark. The Richard Riordan Central Library complex is the third largest public library in the United States in terms of book and periodical holdings. Originally named the Central Library, the building was first renamed in honor of the longtime president of the Board of Library Commissioners and President of the University of Southern California, Rufus B. von KleinSmid. The new wing of Central Library, completed in 1993, was named in honor of former mayor Tom Bradley. The complex (i.e., the original Goodhue building and the Bradley wing) was subsequently renamed in 2001 for former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, as the Richard Riordan Central Library. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Public_Library#Central_Library The murals were a civic commission granted to Dean Cornwell that show "Four Great Eras of California History" in a series of four panels: "The Founding of Los Angeles", "The Discovery Era", "The Mission Era" and "The Americanization of California."

   <dcterms:description>Known to be a five-year project, some documentation say the murals were completed in 1932. Some statues were done by Lee Lawrie. -- http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/columns/writing-on-the-wall/central-library-murals-are-also-80-years-old.html [work]</dcterms:description>
