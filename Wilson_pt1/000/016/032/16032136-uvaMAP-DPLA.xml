   <dcterms:description>Commissioned by the three unmarried sisters of James Culbertson in 1911, the Cordelia Culbertson house in Pasadena's fashionable Oak Knoll district was the largest commission received by the firm at that time, at just over $150,000. ... The clients, Cordelia, (the eldest sister and the official client on record) Kate and Margaret, wanted all the rooms on one level, and the bedrooms on an upper level. ... By 1917, the Culbertson sisters could no longer afford the upkeep and sold the property. The new owner, Mrs. Dudley P. Allen of Cleveland, Ohio, (soon remarried as Mrs. Francis Fleury Prentiss) continued to commission work from the Greenes, most notably Charles Greene, who painted five scenic panels in the entrance hall, and designed additional furnishings. Elisabeth Prentiss also commissioned from Henry Greene a lath house and other garden-related work, including a planting plan for a new lot that she had annexed to her property. These commissions, most of them for minor alterations and repairs, continued into the late 1930s. -- http://www.usc.edu/vh/greeneandgreene/137b.html [work]</dcterms:description>
