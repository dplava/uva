   <dcterms:description>The Aline Barnsdall Hollyhock House [was] originally designed by Frank Lloyd Wright as a residence for oil heiress Aline Barnsdall, built in 1919â€“1921. The building is now the centerpiece of the city's Barnsdall Art Park. [work]</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>Barnsdall originally intended the house to be part of an arts and theater complex on a property known as Olive Hill, but the larger project was never completed. [Wright] delegated many of the responsibilities involved in designing the house to his son, Lloyd Wright. [work]</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>Disillusioned by the costs of construction and maintenance, Barnsdall donated the house to the city of Los Angeles in 1927 under the stipulation that a fifteen-year lease be given to the California Art Club for its headquarters, which it maintained until 1942. The house has been used as an art gallery and as a United Service Organizations (USO) facility over the years. [work]</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>The U.S. Department of the Interior designated Hollyhock House a National Historic Landmark in 2007. [work]</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>In January 2015 it was announced on the official site that, following extensive renovations, the house would once again open for tours on 13 February. -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollyhock_House [work]</dcterms:description>
