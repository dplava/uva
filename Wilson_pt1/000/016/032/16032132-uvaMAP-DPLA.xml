   <dcterms:description>The Lucy E. Wheeler Residence, designed by Charles and Henry Greene, is the last remaining example of the firm's work in the City of Los Angeles. This Craftsman-style residence was commissioned by Miss Lucy Wheeler, the proprietor of a stenography and mimeograph service whose early clients included the Greenes. [work]</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>Located in the Harvard Heights Historic Preservation Overlay Zone (HPOZ), the two-story house is clad in redwood shingles and features wide eaves. In 1917, alterations by architects Robert F. Train and Robert E. Williams included the addition of a sensitively designed full-length front porch. At a later date, the house was enlarged with a rear addition and was eventually converted into rental units; the stained redwood shingles and interior woodwork were also painted. [work]</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>The house remained in this state until purchased in the mid-1980s by the late preservation architect (and Los Angeles Conservancy co-founder) Martin Eli Weil. His extensive restoration work uncovered original Greene and Greene finishes and paint colors, and returned the house back to its early appearance. Several original Greene and Greene-designed interior elements remain intact, including light fixtures, built-ins, and hardware. The Conservancy holds an exceptionally detailed easement on this home's exterior and interior features, including original colors and finishes that Weil identified through his historic analysis. -- https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/lucy-e-wheeler-residence [work]</dcterms:description>
