   <dcterms:description>Wallace Nutting's sign advertising the house</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>Built from timber felled in 1687 and 1688, the structure was at some point owned by Massachusetts Bay Colony military and government leader Samuel Appleton Jr., who also owned the ironworks site through 1690. But the house was later altered, even before it was bought by preservationist Wallace Nutting. -- https://harvardmagazine.com/2016/09/innovation-colonial-style ; [Nutting] built an addition, a front porch, and the gables; he also installed diamond-paned windows and enlarged the hearthsâ€”all of which might have existed in the 1680s, but which also simply appealed to him. -- https://harvardmagazine.com/2016/09/iron-works-house [work]</dcterms:description>
