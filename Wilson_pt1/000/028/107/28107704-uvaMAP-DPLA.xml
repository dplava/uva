   <dcterms:description>In 1908 [Stickley] began acquiring the property on what is now the western edge of Parsippany-Troy Hills, an area formerly part of Morris Plains, where he envisioned establishing a farm school for boys. The focal point of his "Garden of Eden" was a large, log house constructed of hewn chestnut logs found on-site and local stone also found on-site. [work]</dcterms:description>
   <dcterms:description>Stickley originally designed the main house at Craftsman Farms as a "club house", a gathering place for workers, students and guests. In its huge kitchen, meals could be prepared for 100 people. When Stickley decided that the school's opening would have to be delayed for several years, he modified the upstairs plans to accommodate his family, Stickley and his family lived at Craftsman Farms until 1915, when he filed for bankruptcy. -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craftsman_Farms [work]</dcterms:description>
